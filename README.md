# To-Do List App

This is a simple, single-page **To-Do List application** built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
The app runs entirely in the browser without any backend or database, using local component state to manage tasks.  
It's designed to be lightweight and easily deployable as a static site.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The entire application is contained within a single `index.html` file.  
It uses a few key technologies loaded directly from a **CDN (Content Delivery Network):**

- **React**: For building the UI and managing component state.  
- **Babel**: To transpile JSX into standard JavaScript.  
- **Tailwind CSS**: For clean and modern styling.

## üöÄ Deployment

Since this is a **static HTML file**, it can be deployed to any hosting service that supports static sites, such as:

- Vercel  
- Netlify  
- GitHub Pages  

### Deploy on Vercel:

1. Create a new **GitHub repository** for this project.  
2. Add the `index.html` file to the root of your repository.  
3. Push your changes to GitHub.  
4. Connect your GitHub repository to your **Vercel** account.  
5. Vercel will automatically detect the `index.html` file and deploy your app.
